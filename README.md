# CHURN-ANALYSIS
Subject: Key Findings on Customer Retention Analysis
Dear Janet
I hope this message finds you well. I have completed the analysis on the customer retention data and would like to share my findings. Below are the key insights, potential action points, and recommendations based on my analysis.
1.Overview of the Analysis:
I have analysed customer behaviour to understand key trends affecting retention rates. The key metrics analysed include customer churn, demographic and service trends in churn
# Key Findings:
# 1) Demographics:
churn category trends	values
Total churn	1869
 Female 	939
 Male   	930
	Females were more likely to churn
	25% of total churning was caused by senior citizens
	The customers who don’t have partners were more churning than those who have
	The tenure was derived into 4 bins as shown below which conveys that if the tenure increases churn value decreasing by 49%
tenure(months)	bins	churn value
>=20	0-20	1251
>=40	21-40	315
>=60	41-60	210
>=100	61-100	93
# 2) Services:
	We have total 8 services i.e. Phone services, Multiple Lines, Internet Service, Online Security, Online Backup, Tech Support, StreamingTV, Streaming Movies. Out of which phone services were more used and 26% of customers were churned in phone services up to date.
Service	Churn percentage
StreamingTV	30
Streaming Movies 29
Multiple Lines 28
phone services	26
Device protector 22
Online Backup 21
Tech Support 15
Online Security 14
# Average Monthly Charge (64.4)> Churn average Monthly Charge (74.4)
# Churned customers were paying more on average than the remaining customers
This suggests that you may be losing higher-value customers (i.e., customers who paid more on average per month.
# Suggestions for Improving Customer Retention
# 1. Targeted Retention Strategies for High-Churn Demographics
# •	Females and Senior Citizens:
o	Since females and senior citizens represent higher churn groups (25% of churn from seniors), consider tailored retention campaigns targeting these groups. For example:
	Senior Citizens: Offer discounts, loyalty rewards, or additional support, such as more personalized customer service or easy-to-use service bundles.
	Females: Investigate if there's a particular pain point (e.g., customer support issues, pricing, or service satisfaction) that is more prominent in this group. Targeted surveys or focus groups could help.
•	Customers Without Partners:
o	Customers without partners are more likely to churn. Consider introducing family or multi-user plans that offer bundled services at a discount. This could reduce the churn rate for those customers by providing them with a reason to stay engaged.
# 2. Improving Retention for Long-Term Customers
•	Tenure-Based Retention:
o	Your data shows that churn decreases with tenure. Customers who have been with the company for longer periods (greater than 60 months) are much less likely to churn.
o	To further improve retention:
	Incentivize Loyalty: Reward long-tenure customers with loyalty perks, such as exclusive discounts, free service upgrades, or early access to new features.
	Proactive Engagement: Contact long-tenure customers with personalized offers to remind them of their value and avoid complacency.
# 3. Service-Specific Improvements
•	Focus on Services with High Churn:
o	Services like Streaming TV, Streaming Movies, and Multiple Lines have higher churn rates (30%, 29%, and 28%, respectively). You should consider the following:
	Streaming Services: Review customer satisfaction levels, service quality, and pricing for streaming services. If customers are leaving for better offerings, consider enhancing the content library or offering more attractive packages.
	Multiple Lines: This suggests that some customers may be dissatisfied with the pricing or flexibility of the plan. Consider offering more customizable packages or loyalty benefits for customers who have multiple services.
	Phone Services: With 26% churn here, investigate whether service quality (e.g., call quality or network reliability) or pricing is causing dissatisfaction. Introduce targeted retention offers or incentives for long-term phone customers.
•	Service Bundles: Consider bundling services (e.g., internet, phone, and streaming) to make them more attractive. Offer discounts or additional features for customers who subscribe to multiple services.
# 4. Contract and Billing Improvements
•	Month-to-Month Contracts:
o	Since Month-to-Month contract customers are significantly more likely to churn (88%), you should consider:
	Incentivizing Long-Term Contracts: Offer discounts or bonuses for customers who commit to longer-term contracts (e.g., 12-month or 24-month plans). This could reduce churn by locking in customers for a longer period.
	Automatic Renewal Options: Provide incentives like discounts or extra features for customers who agree to auto-renew their contracts.
•	Billing Methods:
o	Given that electronic checks are the most used billing method, you could:
	Streamline Billing: Ensure the billing process is smooth, easy to understand, and error-free. Simplify payment options for customers who prefer to use other methods (credit card, debit card, etc.).
	Incentivize On-Time Payments: Offer small discounts or benefits to customers who pay on time or choose recurring billing options.
5. Focus on Higher-Value Customers
•	Churned Customers Are Paying More:
o	The fact that churned customers were paying more on average than remaining customers suggests that you are losing higher-value customers.
o	Customer Retention Campaigns for Higher-Paying Segments:
	Develop retention campaigns specifically for higher-paying customers. This could include:
	Exclusive Offers: Provide these customers with exclusive, personalized offers such as service upgrades, customized plans, or loyalty rewards.
	Address Pain Points: If you identify any specific dissatisfaction among high-paying customers (e.g., customer service issues, service limitations, or competitive offers), focus on improving these areas.
6. Customer Satisfaction Surveys and Feedback
•	Gather Feedback from Churned Customers:
o	Understand the reasons for churn more deeply by gathering feedback from customers who leave. Use surveys or exit interviews to pinpoint common causes of dissatisfaction, such as price, service quality, or competition.
o	Implement continuous feedback loops for current customers, allowing them to voice concerns before they decide to leave. Offering incentives for feedback can also help you get more valuable insights.
7. Monitoring and Reporting
•	Ongoing Monitoring of Churn Trends:
o	Set up regular churn analysis to monitor trends across various demographics, services, and contract types. By tracking these metrics over time, you can proactively identify at-risk customer groups and take early action to retain them.
# •	Retention KPIs: Establish and track key performance indicators (KPIs) for customer retention, such as churn rate, customer lifetime value (CLTV), and the cost of retention campaigns vs. cost of acquisition.
# Summary of Key Recommendations:
1.	Target retention efforts towards females, senior citizens, and customers without partners.
2.	Incentivize long-term contracts and loyalty programs to reduce churn, especially for month-to-month customers.
3.	Focus on high-churn services like StreamingTV, MultipleLines, and Phone Services.
4.	Offer retention incentives to high-paying customers who are at risk of churning.
5.	Use feedback and surveys to identify reasons for churn and improve service quality accordingly.
By implementing these strategies, you can improve retention rates, reduce churn, and keep valuable customers engaged with your services.
